# Optimizing inductors using the hill climbing algorithm
Here I present an implementation of the hill climbing algorithm for optimizing distributed-wound planar inductors.

## Description of the repository structure
* "tools" - the main functions for the operation of the algorithms are stored here.
* "test_optimization_hill_climbing" - here I present data for test problems and their solution using the "Hill Climbing" algorithm.
* "hill_climbing_optimization" - Here is an implementation of the "Hill Climbing" algorithm for distributing internal turns in a flat inductor
